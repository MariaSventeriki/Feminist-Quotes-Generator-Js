# Feminist-Quotes-Generator-Js

https://mariasventeriki.github.io/Feminist-Quotes-Generator-Js/

This Random Quotes project is fairly simple. It calls for you to access the properties on an object that's embedded inside of an Array. When the “Generate Feminist Quote” button is pressed, it triggers a change in quote and the author who said it.

Project was taken from https://jsbeginners.com/javascript-projects-for-beginners/
